# gabs-simon/articles
Node CLI app for managing articles I have written or am currently in the process of writing.

* Articles can be found as content on the folder `./content` (maybe on their own repo once there are enough of them?)
* Source code for the node app can be found at `./src`
* Available commands are listed on `package.json`
